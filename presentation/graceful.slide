* Graceful shutdown

Graceful shutdown allows you to shutdown the http.Server without interrupting any active connections. Shutdown works by first closing all open listeners, then closing all idle connections, and then waiting indefinitely for connections to return to idle and then shut down.

* Pre 1.8 approach
